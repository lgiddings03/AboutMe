                    Hi, Im Liz. I was born in Arad, Romania. I was gifted with two more biological siblings. Spent most of my life growing up in Wisconsin. I played volleyball libero, even had the chance to participate in Notre Dame's Volleyball camp a few years in middle school. When Volleyball ended I spent the rest of my time as a compteitive swimmer. As far as academics, I did placed 13th in the nation competiitng in Business Professional of America for Human Resource management. Short after high school, I discoverd I didn't want to be apart of HR. Some how web developing looked more interesting.

                <p>I'm a little all over the place. Out of the box thinking has always my favorite way to go. If you don't think it, then you'll never figure out how to see it.</p>
